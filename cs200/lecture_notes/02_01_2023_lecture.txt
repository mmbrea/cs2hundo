import statements before any classes - no packages to be used in this course
- zxybooks will get confused if we use packages/package statements
- only useing default package

in Java, everything in classes - so class next

= is assignment in java
whatever is in right side, put on left.

need to memorize and recognize 8 primitive data types

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Convert {
   public static void main(String []args) {
      Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
      int feet = input.nextInt();
      int inches = input.nextInt();

      final double METERS_PER_FOOT = 0.3048;
      final double METERS_PER_INCH = 0.0254;
      double meters = feet * METERS_PER_FOOT + inches * METERS_PER_INCH;

      System.out.println( "height in meters: " + meters);
   }

}
